# Data Structures and Algorithms Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for the Data Structures and Algorithms course in `Innopolis University`. 

## Course Overview

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and implementation of various fundamental data structures and algorithms. The key topics include:

- Basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash tables
- Advanced data structures: Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Sets
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- Searching algorithms: Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search
- Graph algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Algorithmic paradigms: Greedy, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming
